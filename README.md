Module 14 Challenge

Create and build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button BIodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, OTU) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 

To create an interactive dashboard, these were the following steps:
1. Read the URL json file, https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json, using D3 library.
2. Create horizontal bar chart with dropdown menu to display top 10 OTUs found for chosen individual.
3. Create bubble chart that displays each samples values for corresponding otu_ids/sample_values key value pair for each OTU_ids per chosen individual
4. Display sample metadata into a demographic information section
5. Update all plots when new sample is selected. 
6. Add gauge chart to plot weekyl washing frequency of the individual
7. Deployy the app to Github Pages.
